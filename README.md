# Conway-Game-of-Life
A simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life in Python, running in your terminal!

To run this code, save it to a file and then run it with the following command, replacing size with the desired size of the grid, num_cells with the number of initial live cells, and x1,y1, x2,y2, and so on with the starting positions of the cells:
```python filename.py size num_cells x1,y1 x2,y2 ...```
